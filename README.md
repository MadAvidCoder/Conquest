### Play it [here](https://madavidcoder.github.io/Conquest)!
Conquer medieval Europe in this unique turn-based grand strategy game of empires and conflicts.

## 🎮 Play
#### Head over to [https://madavidcoder.github.io/Conquest](https://madavidcoder.github.io/Conquest) to play!

To win the game, you must conquer all the territories on the map. However if you lose control of all your territories, your empire will collapse, and you will lose the game.

Each territory has three main factors: population, army size, and resources. At the end of each round, all of these will increase. You can spend resources on upgrades, which will assist you in conquering other territories.

Each round of the game is made up of three key phases: Attack, Upgrade, and Transfer. After these three phases, the engine will compute.

### ⚔️ Attack
In the attack phase, you have the opportunity to expand your empire, through battling against neighbouring territories. Select one of your empire's territories, and then select an opposing neighbouring territory, to view stats about the two. If you wish to launch the attack, click the 'Attack' button. The engine will then compute the battle. If you defeat the opposing territory will become a part of your empire. If you lose, the opposing territory will become hostile towards your empire, and may retalliate in the future. The attacking territory will still remain a part of your empire, even if you lose, but the army will suffer losses.

### ⏫ Upgrade
In the upgrade phase, you can improve your territories by investing in improvements. Each territory has a resource supply, which increases each round, and can be spent on upgrades. When you select a territory, its resource supply will be shown. If you click on the 'Upgrade' button, its upgrade tree will appear. Here you can hover over each of the upgrades to view a short description. If you click on one of the available upgrades, a popup will show the resource costs, and confirm if you wish to purchase that upgrade. Some territory upgrades may need to be unlocked on the global tree.

Additionally to the territory upgrades, there is a global upgrade tree. Here you can get upgrades that will improve your whole empire. Some of these upgrades may also be required to unlock territory upgrades. Hover over the upgrades to view more information.

### ↔️ Transfer
The final phase of each round is the transfer phase. Here you can move troops between your empire's territories. Click on the territory you wish to transfer from, and then trace the path you wish them to travel. Once you're ready, click 'Transfer', which will bring up a dialogue to select how many troops you want to transfer. However watch out, as there's a catch - each territory you go through will cause a small number of the contingent to be lost. Neutral territories will incurr more losses, while allied territories will only cause you to lose a very small amount.

After this phase, the engine will compute increases in every country's population, army, and resources. Additionally, each hostile territory may attack a neighbouring territory. Furthermore, there is a chance that a random territory will become hostile.
